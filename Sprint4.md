# Accomplishments in Sprint-4

## Application Description

ParkS is an application that solves the problem of parking spaces. This application serves for two stake holders, users who are in search for a parking space and users who are willing to rent a parking space. Once the user logins, the users can view and book an already listed parking space or can list a new available parking space. Integration of maps into this application helps the users navigate to the desired parking space very easily. Users who want to list a parking space can also locate their parking space using maps. Once the users selectes a desired parking space, the user would be re-directed to the payment gateway for the payment of the space.
