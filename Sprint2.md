# Accomplishments in Sprint-2

1. We have developed few UI-enhancements and made the homepage with better ui chnages.
2. We have added `Maps-API` to the Renters and Buyers pages. This echnacemnet will be in-progreess from the sprint3 aswell.
3. The `Login-API` now matches the `user credentials` with the database.
4. So the fucntionality checks for credentials and verifys and sends a `success` message if the api works fine and an `error` message when the api throws an error. 
5. The `Registration-API` now check if the user already exists. If such senario happens the user gets redirected to the `login-page`.

7. Wer have devloped `getUserWithID-API`, `editUserAPI` and `deleteUserAPI`.
8. The `Add-new-address-API` is developed and the integration is in-progress.
9. We have developed `Get-all-addresses-API`. This api fetchs all the addresses for listing purpose.
10. We have added the `Cypress` testing framework to the project.
